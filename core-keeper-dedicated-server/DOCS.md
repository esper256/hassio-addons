# Core Keeper Dedicated Server

## Configure and start

1. On **Configuration**, set at least:
   - **World name** (default `FamilyCore`)
   - Leave **Game ID** and **Join password** blank unless you want to pin specific codes
   - Leave **World slot** at `0` unless you already keep several caverns
2. Do **not** look for a “list on server browser” toggle — this app has none. Direct Connect is on (IP:port + password); Steam Game ID join still works. Nothing is listed publicly.
3. **Start** the app. First Steam download can take several minutes (~650 MB) — watch **Logs**.
4. Forward **UDP 7778** on your router to this Home Assistant host (change the Network port in HA only if 7778 is already taken).
5. Copy the **Game ID** and **Join password** from **Logs** (lines `Game ID: …` and `Join password: …`, or the `----- GameInfo.txt -----` block after Unity boots). Treat them like passwords.
6. In Core Keeper → **Multiplayer** → **Join Game Via IP** (HA host IP, port **7778**, join password), or **Join Game** with the Game ID.

## OPEN WEB UI

With the app **started**, use **OPEN WEB UI** on the Info tab (optional: **Show in sidebar**).

That page shows server status, players, game version / updates, world save, backups, restore, and troubleshooting tools. It uses Home Assistant Ingress — no extra host port.

The Info **Ingress** chip that only explains ingress is not the UI.

## Settings that matter

| Setting | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| World name / slots | Name connecting clients see; max players (default 8) |
| World slot | Which save to host (`0` → `0.world.gzip`, … `29`). Switching slot does not delete the other files |
| World mode / seed | Only for a **new** slot (`0` Normal, `1` Hard, `2` Creative, `4` Casual) |
| Game ID | Steam Join Game code; blank → stable generated ID for this install. Invalid values are ignored |
| Join password | Direct Connect (IP join) password; blank → stable generated password. Game ID join does not use this |
| Steam branch | `public` (default) or `beta` — clients must match |
| Update on start | SteamCMD before launch (recommended) |
| Daily Steam check hour | Default **5** |
| Update only when empty | Wait for nobody online before restarting |
| Backup retention | `minimal` / `standard` / `extended` — applied **per world slot** |
| HA notifications | Crash / update failure / version mismatch |
| Network → UDP port | Host port for Direct Connect (default 7778) |

The world file is often missing until Unity creates the cavern (first player join, or a graceful stop after a new world has started). Backups skip an empty slot until then. Open Web UI backs up the **active** slot only; other slots keep their own backup history.

## Backups and restore

Use **OPEN WEB UI** → **World backups** to restore a listed backup, start **NEW WORLD**, or upload a save. Restoring stops the server, makes a world backup, then restores onto the **active** slot. Anyone online is disconnected. A backup named for another slot is refused until you switch **World slot** to match. **NEW WORLD** clears the active slot only. Upload a `.world.gzip` for this game (single-file save).

## Logs

- App **Logs** — supervisor, SteamCMD, and game output (includes **Game ID:** and **Join password:**)
- **OPEN WEB UI** → **Troubleshooting** — captures, JSON pattern examples (`/api/logs/suggest` works without Debug mode), and status tools
